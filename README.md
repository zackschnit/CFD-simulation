# CFD-simulation
This repo holds the files for a CFD simulation which was programed as a final project for PHYS 1211: Computational Problem Solving for Physics. 

# Structure of this repo

All intermediate files are directly in the 'final-project-zackschnit' folder. These are referenced by the final paper which outlines the process in creating this program so they are also included in this folder. The final paper is written as a Jupyter Notebook file titled "Creating a CFD simulation.ipynb".

The files used in the final project are in the folder titled final_files; **these are the only files that need to be viewed as all other files are either .gifs or intermediate steps in my process.** Of these three files, the only one intended to run as a stand-alone is wind_tunnel.py. Information about the other files is included in the final paper.

The folder titles "Images" in the final_files folder is for jpg images for objects to be included in the wind tunnel.
